= Normalize
:toc:

Application is normalizing values in file. +
Firstly app is reading file using scala.io.Source.Next app is finding max value and min value. Finally it normalize values with equation:
[source]
((x - min)/(max - min))*2 - 1

(Given equation in the task is not matching results for the samples)
[source]
((x - min) * 2 / max - min) - 1

All methods are using Iterators to read each line one on a time. This was made for reading big files.

At the end app is writing results to file.

== Dependencies
